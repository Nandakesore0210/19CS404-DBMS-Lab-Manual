# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views

## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

**Types:**
- **Single-row subquery**:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- **Multiple-row subquery**:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- **Correlated subquery**:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
**Create View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Drop View:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Question 1**
--
Write a SQL query to Retrieve the medications with dosages equal to the highest dosage
Medications Table

For example:

Result
medic  medication_name  dosage
-----  ---------------  ---------------
4      Acetaminophen    600mg


```sql
SELECT 
medication_id AS medic,
medication_name,
dosage
FROM Medications
WHERE CAST(REPLACE(dosage,'mg','') AS INTEGER)=(SELECT MAX(CAST(REPLACE(dosage,'mg','') AS INTEGER))
FROM Medications);
```

**Output:**

**Question 2**
---
From the following tables write a SQL query to find all orders generated by New York-based salespeople. Return ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id, salesman_id.


For example:

Result
ord_no      purch_amt   ord_date    customer_id  salesman_id
----------  ----------  ----------  -----------  -----------
70002       65.26       2012-10-05  3002         5001
70005       2400.6      2012-07-27  3007         5001
70008       5760.0      2012-09-10  3002         5001
70013       3045.6      2012-04-25  3002         5001

```sql
-- Paste your SQL code below for Question 2
```
